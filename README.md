# ATM Controller

## Instructions


## Completion Log

Generally, ATM would have some controller to control actual hardware related to the ATM. 
This will includes reading card information from a card reader, and receiving data from keypads and touch screens.
Also, it needs to communicate with the Bank system to retrieve user information. 
Actual data would be stored into Bank's database securly with encryptions. 
ATM would not store actual information and needs to communicate Bank's server to get/store data.

So, I divided project into two parts: 1. ATM controller to interact with user. 2. Bank system to receive request from ATM and send respond.
